// Package cloudtrace provides primitives for Cloud Trace integration.
//
// Deprecated: Google Cloud now officially supports the W3C standard for trace-context in their various products
// and recommends using that instead. On top of that OpenTelemetry now also has official support for tracing so we
// recommend using opentelemetry package for working with traces.
